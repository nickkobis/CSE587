In the summer of 208 during the Han Dynasty the imperial army led by chancellor Cao Cao embarks on a campaign to eliminate the southern warlords Sun Quan and Liu Bei in the name of eradicating rebels with the reluctant approval of Emperor Xian Cao Caos mighty army swiftly conquers Jing Province and the Battle of Changban is ignited when Caos cavalry starts attacking civilians on an exodus led by Liu Bei During the battle Liu Beis followers including his sworn brothers Guan Yu and Zhang Fei give an excellent display of their combat skills by holding off the enemy while buying time for the civilians to retreat The warrior Zhao Yun fights bravely to rescue Liu Beis entrapped family but only succeeds in rescuing Lius infant son Following the battle Liu Beis advisor Zhuge Liang embarks on a diplomatic mission to Jiangdong to form an alliance between his lord and Sun Quan to deal with Cao Caos invasion Sun Quan was initially in the midst of a dilemma of whether to surrender or resist but his decision to resist Cao Cao hardens after Zhuge Liangs clever persuasion and a subsequent tiger hunt with his viceroy Zhou Yu and sister Sun Shangxiang Meanwhile naval commanders Cai Mao and Zhang Yun from Jing Province pledge allegiance to Cao Cao and are received warmly by Cao who places them in command of his navy After the hasty formation of the alliance the forces of Liu Bei and Sun Quan call for a meeting to formulate a plan to counter Cao Caos army which is rapidly advancing towards Red Cliff from both land and water The battle begins with Sun Shangxiang leading a light cavalry unit to lure Cao Caos vanguard force into the allies Bagua Formation The vanguard force is defeated by the allies but Cao Cao shows no disappointment and proceeds to lead his main army to the

the alliance had collapsed At the same time Cai Mao and Zhang Yun propose a new tactic of interlocking the battleships together with iron beams to minimize rocking when sailing on the river and reduce the chances of the troops falling seasick ImageRed CliffjpgrightthumbSun Quans forces look on as Liu Bei leaves the alliance From right to left Zhou Yu  Sun Quan  Lu Su Hou Yong  Subsequently Zhou Yu and Zhuge Liang make plans on how to eliminate Cai Mao and Zhang Yun and produce 100000 arrows respectively They agreed that whoever fails to complete his mission will be punished by execution under military law Zhuge Liangs ingenious strategy of letting the enemy shoot 20 boats covered in straw brings in over 100000 arrows from the enemy and makes Cao Cao doubt the loyalty of Cai Mao and Zhang Yun On the other hand Cao Cao sends Jiang Gan to persuade Zhou Yu to surrender but Zhou tricks Jiang instead into believing that Cai Mao and Zhang Yun are planning to assassinate Cao Both Zhuge Liang and Zhou Yus respective plans complement each other when Cao Cao is convinced despite earlier having doubts about Jiang Gans report that Cai Mao and Zhang Yun were indeed planning to assassinate him by deliberately donating arrows to the enemy Cai Mao and Zhang Yun are executed and Cao Cao realises his folly afterwards but it is too late In Sun Quans camp Sun Shangxiang returns from Cao Caos camp

resulting southeast wind will blow to their advantage Before the battle Sun Quans forces have a final moment together feasting on rice dumplings to celebrate the Winter Solstice Meanwhile Zhou Yus wife Xiaoqiao heads towards Cao Caos camp alone secretly hoping to persuade Cao to give up his ambitious plans but fails and decides to distract him instead to buy time for her side The battle begins when the southeast wind starts blowing in the middle of the night and Sun Quans forces launch their attack on Cao Caos navy On the other hand Liu Beis forces which had apparently left the alliance start attacking Cao Caos forts on land By dawn Cao Caos entire navy has been destroyed The allies launch another offensive on Cao Caos ground army stationed in his forts and succeed in breaking through using testudo formation despite suffering heavy casualties Although Cao Cao is besieged in his main camp he manages to hold Zhou Yu hostage after catching him off guard together with Cao Hong Xiahou Jun also appears holding Xiaoqiao hostage and causing the allies to hesitate Just then Zhao Yun manages to reverse the situation by rescuing Xiaoqiao with a surprise attack and put Cao Cao at

Ridiculii plus a bonus name for the Road Runners beep Beepiusbeepius The chase then moves around mountain corners until it ends on a mountainside with the Road Runner ducking behind a corner and leaving a cloud of dust for the coyote to run into Wile E rides the dust cloud all the way through the air and finally stops to determine where he is a question mark appearing over his head He opens a door in the cloud only to see that he is in midair and sheepishly closes the door as the cloud disperses and then changes his question mark of surprise to an exclamation point before the inexorable pull of gravity takes effect 1 The pair pull up onto opposite outcroppings and Wile E attempts to polevault from his to his opponents but this causes the end of his outcropping to crumble and the coyote to fall down Seeing his impending humiliation approaching Wile E attempts to make the best of it by climbing up the pole however he keeps falling back to the bottom of it Eventually the pole turns around so fast that it whirs like a propeller and then grinds against a cliffside all the way down to the part Wile E is holding When it finally stops rotating the coyote then pulls himself onto the narrow bar left of the pole and accepts his fate 2 In a gag that sees four attempts in this cartoon Wile E sits on a rocket and lights the fuse aiming towards the Road Runner on the opposite site of the chasm  The first attempt fails when the fuel and nosecone launch out of the rocket leaving Wile E sitting on an empty hull The hull crunches down and then Wile falls annoyed to the canyon floor 3 As the Road Runner burns rubber on the ground roads Wile E is pulling back on a falling safe attached to a rope and pulley Eventually however the weight overcomes him and the coyote is pulled through the pulley removing all of his chest fur and then down onto a seesaw as the safe lands next to him Wile then slides off the rock face to fall into the canyon a fourth time and is then smashed by the safe leaving the coyotes torso thin and flat 4 The second attempt at the rocket is foiled when the rocket falls out of its aim towards the Road Runner and points directly downwards before it fires leading to an extraspeedy fifth fall 5 Now Ross animates a sequence in which Wile E sticks a firecracker into the center hole of a Frisbee  and throws it at his nemesis but before he releases the disc the firecracker drops out of the hole and sizzles at Wile Es foot The coyote doesnt notice until he puts his foot down on the firework and instinctively pulls it away just before it explodes leaving him dazed but apparently unhurt Wile then walks away like Charlie Chaplin revealing behind him that his tail is on fire unknown to him until he passes the horizon and he yelps in pain 6 On his third attempt with the rocket he lights the fuse but it burns quickly and fires successfully out from under him before he could get ready and leaves Wile floating in midair with a cloud of dust blocking his view below Unable to see what is below him Wile pokes his foot through the cloud and consequently suffers gravity for the sixth time as he holds up a sign stating GOODBYE and then flipping to AGAIN  7 To get the bird to stick Wile leaves out a sheet of ACME Giant Fly Paper in the road and sits down on a rock laughing at his genius He hears a braking noise assumes the Road Runner has been caught and leaps out to catch him but instead of the Road Runner he has caught an actual giant fly The fly is very unhappy about being stuck on the paper and thus wraps the coyote with it who tiptoes away from the scene 8 On his final attempt at the skyrocket Wile E accidentally ignites his tail instead of the fuse and detects his mistake and leaps up in pain only to smash his head on another outcropping Fortunately this causes him to return to the rocket and to light the fuse with his tail and after it takes off is struggling briefly to get control then puts out the fire on his tail Unfortunately the rocket is off target and it bores through the cliff under the Road Runner who allows the coyote to be humiliated privately The rocket finally explodes blackening the coyote and throwing him back into the air Displeased Wile E holds up a yellow sign asking HOW DID I EVER GET INTO THIS LINE OF WORK before falling for a seventh time 9 A new plan is formulated where Wile E attempts to blow up the Road Runner by pelting explosive tennis balls at him The first ball seamlessly blows up a cactus with no issues  and the coyote is eager to try them at work As luck would have it the Road Runner is heard and Wile is quick to lob another ball at him but just misses and the ball then drops onto the arm of a cactus which throws it directly back to its owner A little agitated the coyote returns the ball and this time it is caught by power lines and slung back out of Wile Es reach The ball pops directly back into its original slot in the box of balls as Wile E arrives on the scene and takes stock Sensing the coming explosions Wile E holds up a pair of signs For Sale One used Tennis Racket and CHEAP before  a GIGANTIC EXPLOSION occurs 10 The whole cartoon however is best known for its ending gag Wile E Coyote is chasing the Road Runner through a series of pipelines which causes both of them to emerge in a greatly shrunken state Upon discovering their situation they agree to reenter the pipeline and be transformed back into full size The Road Runner emerges at normal size but Wile is still in small size when he comes out Upon discovering this turn of fortune the Road Runner stops and allows his rival to catch him The coyote doesnt notice anything until he steps over his opponents feet and rushes back to finally catch the Road Runner The coyote is ecstatic and pulls out his knife and fork to eat his opponentuntil he stares more closely at the birds huge legs which are twice as tall as he is and looks up to see he is massively outgunned The Road Runner gives an amplified beepbeep causing Wile to drop his utensils in shock He can only hold up signs to the audience stating Okay wise guys you always wanted me to catch him  and Now what do I do Well

Elizabeth I He explains that he had discovered a planet which exists paradoxically at the edges and center of the universe and due to the strange nature of its position time stands still He created the orb as a way of transporting people to the planet which he calls Neverland The process of creating the sister to the orb which can take the user from Neverland back to Earth was what Peter had witnessed in his dream The tree spirit from the dream thought that Fludd was in danger and tried to save him instead imbuing her with astral energy Fludd named the spirit Tinker Bell who can communicate through telepathy He built the city as a Utopia where all the greatest scientific minds on Earth can live While they plot out a way to rescue the rest of the crew from the pirates they are

film where one may realize the meaning behind the saying crying while laughing and laughing also while crying How both the phenomena happen together can be witnessed via few moments of this film Film rides over the successive sequences of light and sensitive scenes At one moment something light humorous and lively is happening on screen and a smile is flowing on the lips of the characters and audiences also and all of a sudden its followed by a very intense and sensitive sequence and not only characters pass through sad moments but audiences may also feel the impact of those onscreen happenings Those who want to see one of the best performances of Mithun Chakraborty may watch the film for that purpose New actors may learn from his performance how to cover a vast range of emotions while playing a character Light and camera departments have performed very well Sound  though hears loud at some places Students of cinematography may watch the film for very good work performed by Nataraja Subramanian Cinematography is fascinating One very attractive scene he has captured is where Mithun and Tinnu Anand are shown standing at sea shore Film swings between present memories of the past and dreams of future and editor Mahesh Narayan has driven the vehicle of this mixing in such a smooth manner that eyes and attention of an audience may not even realize that a gear has been changed A kind of perfection is there This is not just another love story of senior citizens It has its own merits Story may look familiar but expansion of the story through the events is interesting A couple lives a married life together for 4050 years and then one dies and leaves other to spend rest of the years of hisher life alone One becomes habitual of others presence in every single minute of the life and all of a sudden that person is not here Person has gone but other persons dependency on himher has not been vanished How to handle this loneliness Death is quite an honest enemy it does not accept friendship It kills but it kills for once and all Loneliness is a fastidious enemy One extends the hands of friendship towards it and it becomes more strangely stern in attitude It kills one all the time again and again It kills at home at market place and it does not spare one at temples also At an old age it becomes difficult to fight with the loneliness An old train moves slowly and it follows the discipline of gostopgo It stops at such stations also where if one looks outside the window then he finds silence all over If he gets a signal to go ahead a person goes ahead  Mithun says abovementioned monologue before the mirror in his bedroom and film is based upon the meaning of this monologue Mithun will simply move the audience in the scene where he gets up early in the morning and finds a cigarette kept by his wife Rati Agnihotri on the side table of his bed He leaves the bed picks up the cigarette and calls for his wife He is very happy He is overwhelmed by the loving care which his wife showers upon him He wants to share this happiness with his wife Everything is bringing a smile to the audience but after a few seconds only whole atmosphere is changed into a gloomy one and Mithun had to create two exactly opposite atmospheres and he does this job very effectively A terrific performance he has given in these moments and throughout the film he remains the main source from whom this film gets its maximum strength He has created many very good moments in the film Another remarkable scene is where he is searching his watch and he forgets that Rati is dead now and cries upon realizing it His grand daughter comes there and he conceals his tears from her Another gem of a scene is where he tells Kitu Gidvani that he will not meet or write Dimple ever Plot takes some inspiration from the mythological tale of Radha and Krishna In short Mithuns first love is Dimple but situations separate them in school time only Later he marries Rati and after her death only he again comes in contact with Dimple Two old lovers who are suffering from loneliness try to search solace in each others company which is not initially acceptable to Mithuns daughter in law An entire new generation remains devoid of the pleasure of writing and reading the letters and this film at least shows the use of this old and now obsolete but very good communication method Feelings may be conveyed by the email also but to read something in senders own hand writing certainly enhances the impact of the words Words carry more emotions through hand written letters than email or printed greeting cards Dimple Kapadia adequately supports the film So do Gulshan Grover and Kittu Gidvani Tinnu Anand his Lambretta scooter and his self made CIA theory all the three things are among the other attractive features of the film Rimoh Chakraborty plays the younger version of Mithuns character and he seems to inherit some good percentage of his fathers vast acting talent He may carry Mithun Chakrabortys flag ahead in the acting profession The girl who has played the young version of Dimple Kapadias character acted very well Rati Agnihotri in a role consists of a few scenes only makes her presence noticeable Film has got some very good and meaningful dialogues Nishan pehchan to bata sakte hain haalaat nahin Naram panee ke neeche itane sakht patthar kaise ho sakte hain Ganga

pests and sometimes kept as pets  The Draags are an alien species which is humanoid in shape but a hundred times larger than humans with blue skin fanlike earlobes and huge protruding red eyes The Draags also live much longer than human beings  one Draag week equals a human year Some Oms are domesticated as pets but others run wild and are periodically exterminated The Draags treatment of the Oms is ironically contrasted with their high level of technological and spiritual development The story opens with a woman running occasionally looking behind her as if pursued An enormous hand descends and blocks her way She runs back the way she came and finds her way blocked by another hand It becomes apparent that she is being toyed with by entities that do not appreciate her fragility and as she dies the infant she has been carrying and attempting to protect begins to cry The view changes to reveal the Draag children who have accidentally killed the woman they leave quickly when an adult Draag and child approach The child voices concern for the orphaned infant and the two take the child to their home Tiva  names the infant Terr  Her father whom the adult Terr voiceover explains is master Sinh the Draag great Aedile attaches a collar capable of physically dragging Terr back from mischief and over the next several scenes their relationships develop Terr witnesses the parents seemingly ingesting food by inhaling it from a device After changing Terrs costume as one would a dolls Tiva uses makeup to give herself a more Omlike appearance When Terr impishly trades dark pigment for light Tiva blows some of the powder on him Tiva uses a tiny indoor weathermaker to cause a small storm cloud to form over Terr and chase him around the dwelling Tiva takes Terr for a walk and then teaches him how under certain circumstances crystals will form on stationary objects including standing bipeds She also teaches him that whistling will shatter the crystals Terr happens upon master Sinh as he and several compatriots are melding in a ritual and it is revealed that many Draag children have Oms like Terr when they convene to watch their respective Oms interact Tivas education is supplied by the use of a headset that transmits knowledge directly into the brain of the user Because she enjoys having Terr in her hand when she is having her infos Terr begins to acquire their knowledge Meanwhile at the seat of government Draag Councilors discuss whether the regular extermination of the wild Oms is sufficient to keep their numbers at an acceptable level It is revealed that Oms were first found on a planet that retained some evidence of structured life but the images seem to reveal that Earth was in a postapocalyptic state at the time Terr decides to escape and to take the headset with him He does not get very far before Tiva realizes he is missing and her mother tells her to use her bracelet to bring him back Terr finds himself suddenly being dragged backward by the collar Only the headset becoming entangled in plants allows a wild female Om to come to his rescue before he is choked by the collar or dragged all the way back When Terr explains that the headset contains the knowledge of the Draags but he doesnt know where to go with it his unnamed rescuer takes him to her tribe who live in a tree in a walled park When it is demonstrated that Terr can read Draag script the leader  is willing to accept Terr into the tribe but the Wizard is not and demands a trial by combat  to the death Terr and the Wizards champion have childsized animals bound to their torsos in such a way as to prevent the combatants from using anything but the beaks of said animals to attack Terr is injured but wins the trial Over the next several scenes it is shown how the Oms have adapted to life on the Draags planet Snaillike animals weave clothes onto the Oms predators that would eat Oms are in turn hunted and efficiently stripped of useful materials and the gene pool is kept wellmixed Oms even make the occasional foray into Draag areas in search of resources Returning from one such expedition the group of adventurers is accosted by bandits who drop clawlike harpoons into the cargo and simply lift it up into their own tree Mighty One tells Terr that they live on the other side of the park and cautions him that they are evil When the nowliterate Oms read the new sign on one of the walls they realize the park is about to be deOmised Terr decides that he must take this information to the tribe of bandits and is quickly captured and taken before their leader a wizened old woman The woman is skeptical of his claims and orders Terrs imprisonment When the deOmising begins however the old woman returns and frees him The deOmising is accomplished using disks that release a poison gas A great many Oms perish from this gas but a sizable number still manage to escape through a crack in the park wall Two passing Draags witness the exodus and one begins crushing the Oms underfoot The Oms retaliate and manage to kill their attacker while the other escapes Afterward Mighty one is revealed to be killed and the old woman leads the survivors to a place where she believes they will be safe The death of a Draag puts the Council in an uproar DeOmising is stepped up to a much higher priority new technologies are developed and extermination frequency is scheduled to greatly increase The old woman has led the two nowunited tribes to an old rocket depot Applying their newfound knowledge the Oms under Terrs direction very quickly adapt the abandoned technologies to their own purposes and begin to flourish thanks to the rebirth of mechanized industry On a visit to the old woman Terrs wife hears her express both optimism and regret that she will not live to see the Oms finally find peace Fatalities resulting from Draag attempts to deOm the rocket depot are minimized by the creation and organized use of shelters but the Draags updated deOmising technologies become ever more aggressive and when an automated scout detects the persistent Om settlement it summons an array of lethal devices As the attacks become more diverse and effective the Oms launch their manned rockets toward the Fantastic Planet where they discover headless humanoid statues As Draag meditation bubbles descend to alight atop the statues the statues begin to dance It is revealed via Terrs voiceover that this is the secret of the Fantastic Planet Draag meditation animates the statues and allows the Draag to reproduce When the feet of the dancing statues threaten the rockets the Oms use energy weapons to shatter the statues effectively killing thousands of meditative Draag Pandemonium reigns in the Council chamber for it seems the two species will destroy one another if they cannot find a way to live together Apparently they do just that for in the very next scene an Om steps down off an outstretched Draag hand removes his silly hat and assumes a posture of confidence and selfassertion The headset voice dispassionately recounts the Oms construction of a new satellite where Oms can live which they call Terr after their ancestral planet',

The Bunny Song with lyrics stating that nothing in the world be it God parents healthy food Church or School is more important than the bunny When asked by Rack as to what would happen if someone

inhabitants open it and release a deadly microorganism which is later codenamed Andromeda by the US Army A team is sent from the Armys biodefense department to retrieve the satellite only to die from the disease themselves The video footage recorded by the retrieval team and their strange deaths capture the attention of General George Mancheck the head of the biodefense department who activates Wildfire a team of five scientists who are called upon when highlevel bioterror threats occur in the United States The team headed by its creator Dr Jeremy Stone investigates Piedmont They retrieve the satellite and rescue a hysterical 60year old man and a colicky baby who have survived the Andromeda outbreak In an isolated underground laboratory the Wildfire team begins their examination of the downed satellite and the two survivors The laboratory is powered by a small watercooled nuclear reactor In the event of a contamination breach a 15minute selfdestruct sequence would be automatically initiated however if the activated sequence is deemed unnecessary Major Bill Keane designated by the OddMan Hypothesis is the only person able to deactivate the sequence using his pass key and right thumbprint The scientists begin their analysis of the Andromeda strain by recovering a sample from inside the satellite They initially discover that the microorganism is contained within a delivery system of buckyballs a technology more advanced than anything known at present The team theorizes that Andromeda may have an extraterrestrial origin as it has no DNA or amino acids The team discovers Andromeda is an airborne microorganism that kills its host by entering the bloodstream through the lungs and coagulating the blood in the body causing death within 10 seconds via a blood clot in the brain Those who manage to survive the blood clot become insane extremely violent and suicidal It is revealed that the two survivors from Piedmont had not been affected by Andromeda because of their acidotic blood However all initial tests with antibiotics and chemical agents regularly used to kill other microorganisms show no effect on Andromeda Cable news reporter Jack Nash becomes aware of some of the events related to the fallen satellite and Andromeda As he investigates further Chuck Beeter the Director of the NSA uses General Manchecks aide Colonel Ferrus to perform assassinations to prevent knowledge of Andromeda from reaching the civilian population Nash travels to one of the temporary Army outposts performing quarantine procedures and witnesses the effects of Andromeda spreading through various modes of transportation He becomes a target of assassination due to his presence at the outpost but manages to escape Ferrus and his subordinates In an attempt to neutralize the problem the President of the United States authorizes a small tactical nuclear strike on the quarantine area in hopes of completely irradiating and destroying Andromeda When the Wildfire team is informed they realize that they have not reviewed the test results for irradiating Andromeda They find that the microorganism grows at an exponential rate when irradiated The Wildfire team alerts the President and the airstrike is called off before the pilot launches the nuclear missile However as the jet continues to fly over the quarantine area the pilot reports a malfunction of the aircrafts controls Through video feed the Wildfire team and President watch in shock and horror as all plastic components of the aircraft including the pilots visor disintegrate The nuclear missile is rearmed the jet and missile crash into the ground and the missile detonates irradiating the quarantine area The team examine the footage of the crash and realize that Andromeda did not attack the pilot until after the missile launch sequence was halted leading the team to believe that Andromeda has the ability to think They also realize that Andromeda has mutated into several variations with different means of spreading and different effects As Andromeda grows and mutates into more virulent forms the Wildfire team continue their tests to find a way to stop Andromeda before it reaches Las Vegas the closest city to the quarantine zone with an international airport Further studies reveals Andromeda is actually a sulfurbased compound A set of tests with phages reveals that one phage has the ability to kill Andromeda However repeated tests with this phage prove unsuccessful causing the Wildfire team to theorize that Andromeda can communicate through an unknown mechanism between its separate parts A binary code encoded on buckyball casings with potassium and rubidium atoms is also discovered The information included the 6digit number 739528 and the word Bacillus infernus encoded in ASCII and a bitmap image of a symbol with interlocking triangles Bacillus infernus is the name of an archaebacterium found only at the thermal vents on the ocean floors At this time President Scott was championing the new and controversial industry of thermal vent mining and it was likely that the mining would eradicate the bacteria The encoded information causes Stone to realize Andromeda must have a connection with Earth and leads Stone to force General Mancheck to reveal the truth about the satellite Mancheck reveals Project Scoop a confidential mission to examine a wormhole that had appeared near Earth It consisted of a satellite sent to collect organic samples but it malfunctioned during the mission and crashed With this information the Wildfire team infer that Andromeda could have been sent from Earths future possibly because society in the future could not destroy the contagion due to a lack of a natural resource  Bacillus infernus Tests with Bacillus infernus reveal that the bacterium easily consumes and destroys Andromeda because of Andromedas sulfur structure The Wildfire team begins to grow large amounts of the bacterium in culture vats intending to release the cultures over the quarantined area once a sufficient quantity is grown The team also begins to destroy the remaining samples of Andromeda in the lab in an attempt to prevent Andromeda from communicating the nature of the tests with its other parts Eventually enough bacteria are grown and they are sprayed over the quarantined area eradicating all traces of Andromeda from the environment As part of a government conspiracy to preserve Andromeda for future use Colonel Ferrus blackmails Dr Barton to keep a sample The sample mutates and disintegrates the sample casing setting off the labs contamination breach sensor and initiating the selfdestruct sequence The selfdestruct sequence also causes the flashing emergency lights to turn on triggering Chous photosensitive epilepsy which causes him to inadvertently destroy the selfdestruct control panel on the lab level of the complex With the elevators deactivated due to the selfdestruct sequence Keane decides to climb to the control panel on the level above through the labs main exhaust vent However the pipes and other components in the vent have begun to deteriorate due to the mutation in the Andromeda sample The pipe Keane climbs suddenly bends dangling Keane above the radioactive water at the base of the vent Before falling Keane manages to throw his badge to Stone Realizing Keanes right thumb is also required to shutdown the selfdestruct sequence Chou sacrifices his life to enter the radioactive water to cut off Keanes thumb for Stone With Keanes thumb and badge Stone reaches the control panel and deactivates the sequences albeit with only seconds to spare As the remaining Wildfire team attends the funerals of their fallen colleagues both General Mancheck and Colonel Ferrus are secretly assassinated Dr Stone reveals some of the events to the public in an interview with Jack Nash In the final scene the saved sample of the Andromeda is inserted into a containment compartment with the access code 739528 held in a vessel marked with a symbol with interlocking triangles Director Beeter watches over the operation on the computer in his office The camera then zooms out revealing Andromeda has been stored within a space station orbiting EarthThe ending implies that the sample saved on the space station is the cause of the outbreak in the future that necessitated sending the virus back to the present via the wormhole creating an ontological paradox as to the virus origin', genre=\"['Science Fiction']\"),\n",

almost a year when Marcellus was in Cana of Galilee At that time Marcellus was told by Paulus that Caligula was then the emperor Marcellus Gallio  son of an important Roman senator  and himself a military tribune begins the film in a prologue that introduces the viewer to the might and scope of the Roman empire He is notorious as a ladies man but he is captivated by the reappearance of a childhood sweetheart Diana  ward of the Emperor Tiberius  and Empress Julia  in Caligulas pavilion As Caligula is the grandnephew and heir to Tiberius Diana is unofficially promised in marriage to him as Empress Julia thinks Diana would be good for him When Caligula comes to the marketplace with military fanfare to take part in the slave auction Marcellus makes the mistake of bidding against him for a defiant Greek slave Demetrius   and winning Caligula feels he had been made a fool of in front of Diana while Marcellus feels that he had wronged Demetrius by stopping him earlier when he had escaped from his slaveholders Angrily Caligula leaves with Diana and the rest of his military escort and issues orders for Marcellus to receive a military transfer to Jerusalem in Palestine Marcellus has Demetrius released and he orders him to go on his own to the Gallio home At the Gallio home Cornelia and Lucia Marcelluss mother and sister are informed by Diana about the situation at the marketplace Lucia remarks that Marcellus is still in love with Diana Marcellus is surprised to find Demetrius waiting for him when he gets home Unofficially Marcellus had freed Demetrius but Demetrius feels honor bound to compensate Marcellus by being his servant Demetrius accompanies Marcellus to Palestine but before the galley sails Diana comes to see Marcellus pledging her love for him and her intention to intercede on his behalf with Tiberius Marcellus declares his love for Diana and asks her to make the emperor promise not to give her in marriage to Caligula Marcellus rides into Jerusalem with the centurion Paulus  on the same day as Jesus triumphal entry on Palm Sunday Jesus confronts Demetrius as he rides into Jerusalem silently calling him with his eyes to be his follower When Demetrius later finds out what the Romans have in store for Jesus he tries to warn him about the intentions of the Romans to arrest him However Jesus has already been arrested as Demetrius finds out from a chance meeting with Judas Jesus is arrested and condemned by Pontius Pilate  the procurator who sends for Marcellus to take charge of the detail of Roman soldiers assigned to crucify him As Pilate finishes washing his hands he tells Marcellus that he is being recalled to Italy by the emperor and tells Marcellus of the duty he must perform before he leaves As Marcellus leaves Pilate pines about the past night and asks for water so that he can wash his hands again Marcellus and the other soldiers cast lots for Jesus robe and Marcellus wins On the way back into Jerusalem Marcellus compels Demetrius to throw the robe over him as the two of them are caught in the rain It is then that Marcellus begins to feel remorse for the crucifixion of Jesus When the robe is on him he has a painful seizure and he orders Demetrius to take it off him When Demetrius does so he has had enough he curses Marcellus and the Roman Empire and runs away Marcellus now behaves like a madman haunted by nightmares of the crucifixion What sets him off is any reference to being out there on Calvary He cries out fitfully Were you out there He does this in the presence of Tiberius himself when he reports to him on Capri Tiberius is portrayed as a benevolent elder statesman who wants to help Marcellus so at the prompting of his soothsayer Dodinius  and Marcelluss own enthusiasm he gives him an imperial commission to find and destroy the robe while gathering a list of names of Jesus followers At Dianas request Tiberius leaves her free to marry Marcellus even though Tiberius believes him to be mad After leaving Capri Marcellus is next seen sometime later with a Syrian guide Abidor  outside the village of Cana He is posing as a cloth merchant going about buying up homespun cloth To further his investigation Marcellus pays exorbitant prices for any kind of cloth even rags Justus a weaver in Cana  reprimands his fellow Christians for accepting such unfair prices as being contrary to the teachings of Jesus and his fellow Christians give back the excess amounts voluntarily Seeing Justus as a lead in his investigations Marcellus seeks to ingratiate himself with Justus by giving his young grandson Jonathan  whose club foot had been healed by Jesus one of his pack donkeys Marcellus also wanders in on a public performance by the paralytic Miriam as she sings a song of Jesus resurrection When Marcellus returns to his camp he is confronted by a greedy Abidor who wants to turn in Justus and the others to Pilate who has ordered the arrest of Jesus followers Abidor who is obsessed with making money threatens to tell the people of Cana that Marcellus crucified Jesus which drives Marcellus to beat Abidor and send him away violently The next day Marcellus is furious with Jonathan for giving his donkey to his physically challenged friend David because he did not yet understand the teachings of Jesus Miriam who is sitting nearby kindly confronts Marcellus and urges him to see Peter  who has come to Cana with a Greek companion Marcellus guesses that this is Demetrius and goes off to Shalums Inn to confront him Marcellus finds Demetrius alone and demands that he get the robe and destroy it Demetrius gives the robe to Marcellus who refuses to touch it and Demetrius tells him that if he wants it destroyed he will have to destroy it himself Marcellus picks the robe up with his sword and as he becomes frozen with fear the robe slides down the sword onto him He is terrified but this time as the robe touches him he finds that the pain he has been carrying since the robe first touched him vanishes and that he is no longer afraid He feels the true power of the robe and of the one who wore it In that moment Marcellus believes in Jesus Christ is relieved from the madness of his guilt and becomes a Christian The two men go outside and Justus calls the villagers together and begins to introduce Peter Justus tells the gathered crowd that on the night of Jesus arrest only Peter stood by Jesus Peter tries to correct Justus but Justus tells Peter that his turn to speak will come and continues Suddenly Justus is pierced by an arrow and falls The assembly turns to see Paulus and a large detachment of Roman soldiers with the gloating Abidor lurking among them Several other villagers are killed before Marcellus intervenes ordering them to stop Paulus informs him that his orders are no longer valid Tiberias is dead and Caligula is emperor Marcellus informs Paulus that an imperial commission is valid even after a Roman emperor dies Paulus tells Marcellus to make him obey via a sword duel Marcellus asks Paulus if he will keeps his word to withdraw the troops if Marcellus wins the duel Paulus says that if Marcellus wins the troops are his because Paulus will be dead Marcellus accepts the challenge to a duel After a prolonged struggle Marcellus prevails Rather than killing Paulus as is expected of him Marcellus hurls his sword into a tree He challenges Paulus to give the order to his soldiers to withdraw Paulus recognizing the mercy extended to him by Marcellus salutes Marcellus and orders the soldiers to leave Peter invites Marcellus to join him and Demetrius as missionaries Marcellus hesitates and when Peter tells him that he denied Jesus three times on the night he was arrested Marcellus confesses his role in Jesus death Peter points out to him that Jesus forgave him from the cross in the dramatic words showcased before Father forgive them for they know not what they do  Marcellus then pledges his life to Jesus and agrees to go with them Their missionary journey takes them through Antioch Ephesus Corinth and then to Rome but they must proceed undercover with their base in the catacombs because the Emperor Caligula has

captured Demetrius is being tortured Diana runs out of the palace to Marcipor  the Gallio family slave who is a secret Christian Diana guesses that Marcipor is a Christian and has seen Marcellus and she gets him to take her to Marcellus Marcellus and Diana are reunited and Marcellus tells her the story of the robe and his own conversion but Diana only thinks the story of Jesus justice and love is a nice story but that the world doesnt work that way Diana gives Marcellus information on where Demetrius is in the imperial palace and Marcellus and his fellow Christians manage to rescue him They

issues orders to bring Marcellus to him alive to stand trial by the end of the day or they will all be sent to the galleys A physician friend of Senator Gallio Marius  is called in to help Demetrius but is unable to heal him Marius states that science has limits Marcellus prays to God and Peter then knocks on the door and ask to be alone with Demetrius Peter lays his hand on Demetrius and heals him Marius a proud man is resentful of Peters ability to heal Demetrius and leaves with the purpose of betraying Marcellus to Caligula Marcellus tells his father Senator Gallio that he wants to return and tell his father more about Christianity however his father says this will be the last time they see each other because he feels his son has betrayed Rome by becoming a Christian and therefore he no longer has a son Marcellus promises Diana that he will send for her tomorrow and kisses Diana as he leaves Marcellus flees with Demetrius but when they are pursued by soldiers Marcellus gives himself up so that Demetrius can escape He is captured and put on trial Diana visit Marcellus in prison on the night before his trial and requests he not defy Caligula Marcellus tells Diana of Miriam the crippled girl who found herself fortunate to be lame of the poor young boy Jonathan to whom Marcellus gave the fine donkey and he then selflessly gave it away to another boy without a second thought and how other Christians do not deny Christ to save their skin Diana wants to believe but does not feel she can if Marcellus dies If he dies now Diana tells him that she feels his death would be for nothing and that she needs Marcellus Caligula makes Diana sit next to him for Marcellus trial He then tells the crowd of Senators and Roman nobles that there is a secret party of seditionists called Christians and how their actions are comparable to the traitor Spartacus He then tells them that one of their own Marcellus has joined these conspirators and thus is being tried by all of them for treason Marcellus informs the crowd that it is true that he is a Christian however he denies the charge that Christians are plotting against the state When Caligula says that Christians believe Jesus is a king Marcellus tells everyone that Jesus is a king but that His Kingdom is not of this world and Jesus seeks to reign in the hearts and mind in the name of justice and charity Caligula asks about the robe that Marcellus is holding and Marcellus tries to show Caligula his opportunity to accept Christ Marcellus tries to hand the robe to Caligula but Caligula refuses to touch it as he considers it to be bewitched He orders one of his soldiers to take the robe and destroy it but Diana asks to keep it instead Marcellus informs Caligula that if Rome turns to the ways of justice and charity then Rome will be saved however if Rome stayed on its present course then it would be destroyed To the crowd this sounds treasonous and Caligula condemns Marcellus to death by the wish of the members of the audience based on what theyve heard Caligula in an effort to show mercy to Marcellus tells him to renew his allegiance to Rome and renounce his faith in Jesus Christ Marcellus kneels to Caligula to renew his pledge to Rome a pledge he states that he has never broken but then stands and states that he cannot renounce his belief in Jesus Marcellus tells Caligula that Jesus is his King and Caligulas King and that Jesus is the Son of God Diana then accepts Christ and seeks to join Marcellus the man she considers to be her husband in His Kingdom When Caligula tells Diana that there are no charges against her she provides a reason for her to be charged with the same crime as Marcellus by telling the audience how evil an emperor Caligula is Caligula screams out as she states her condemnation of his rules and then condemns Diana to die alongside Marcellus As Diana and Marcellus are marched out of the emperors court Diana hands the robe to Marcipor Diana and Marcellus pause to smile at each other as they peacefully walk out of the courtroom to meet their earthly fate A chorus of Hallelujah plays and clouds are in the background behind Diana and Marcellus as the film ends',

that she escapes again forcing Demetrio to unleash the clones on her She manages to evade the two and meets up with Ross and Yoko Yoko is overjoyed to see her mother but recoils when she sees Armitages metal shoulder that was scraped off by the clones Just then they attack While Armitage holds them off Ross and Yoko make their way to an unused space elevator It is here that Yoko shows that she has a photographic memory leading them to the space elevator whose location she determined from a map she saw minutes beforehand  Soon Armitage flees to Mouse who repairs the damage and gives her a program that will allow her to go beyond her limited fighting abilities He tells her that the password is Heavens Door but that if she exceeds more than her internal battery can handle she will be knocking at the Pearly Gates for real She also has him do her one more favor broadcast the footage of the Third massacre attempts all over Earth and Mars  This compels Demetrio to command the clones to prevent the family from leaving After both clones are beaten Demetrio tries having the elevators defenses fired on their shuttle only to be killed by the last remaining clone who is at the time

in general They speculate about whether geographical entities offend each other and whether these disagreements involve them Tjaden speaks familiarly about himself and the Kaiser They speculate about whether it is the Kaiser or the manufacturers that need the war or whether it is the result of a fever Katczinsky suggests roping off a field and stripping the kings and their ministers down to their

not know Mueller lets slip that his right leg has been amputated Kemmerich becomes upset Kemmerich expresses regret that he would never become a forester and Paul tries to reassure him Mueller sees

can do nothing As Kemmerich finally succumbs to his wounds Paul leaves the dressing station with Kemmerichs boots and breaks into a run Mueller is trying to talk about math to Katczinsky when Paul brings him the boots Mueller is pleased and says that he will not mind returning to the front in such fine boots Paul describes how he reacted to Kemmerichs death by running and how it made him feel more alive and then hungry In a sequence of battle scenes Mueller is wounded and his boots are passed on to another soldier who is also wounded and presumed killed One day Corporal Himmelstoss arrives to the front and is immediately spurned because of his bad reputation In an attack on a cemetery Paul stabs a French soldier but finds himself trapped in a hole with the dying man in for an entire

train accelerates dispatcher Frank Barstow is alerted to the situation Unaware of the failure of the brakes Barstow authorizes employees to allow the runaway out onto the mainline arrogantly insisting that a computercontrolled signalling system of his creation will trigger a brake application on the locomotives The last of the brake shoes burn off and the dispatchers realize the severity of their situation forcing them to keep the tracks clear The runaway smashes through the caboose of a freight train that was in the act of moving out of its path The collision badly damages the cab of the lead

must get to the lead engine so that they can press its fuel cutoff switch Sara informs them that they cant because the second locomotive is a carbody Funit with no forward catwalk Its nose door which would normally allow access to the lead engine is jammed from the collision with the freight At her suggestion they are able to slow the train somewhat by disconnecting the MU cables connected to the two rear locomotives shutting them down and slowing the train enough for it to safely cross the Seneca trestle The dispatchers divert the runaway onto a branch after determining it is only five minutes away from a headon collision with a passenger train This is only a brief respite as further ahead the branch negotiates a tight curve adjacent to a chemical plant Even at its reduced speed the runaway is likely to derail on this curve and trigger a major chemical spill His hand forced Barstow agrees that they must switch the runaway onto a stubended siding and crash it thus sending the three people on the train to almost certain death rather than risk a catastrophic chemical explosion Warden Ranken refuses to wait coercing Barstows assistance in chasing down the train by prison

throwing the mutated Warden into a meat grinder In the finale the prisoners rebel once again and start to attack the guards Ricky then breaks the prison wall allowing all the prisoners and himself to go free  The film is notorious for its excessive use of graphic violence and gore primarily due to the fact that the lead character is practically invincible has superhuman strength and can virtually withstand all pain which is partially explained by Ricky being a practitioner of a mystical kungfu style known as Qigong This leads to attempts by other characters to subdue him which end up being

bus returning to the 4077th after a day of drinking at the beaches of Incheon He called for a bottle of whiskey to be passed back to someone who cant wait later he is able to more accurately recall this person was a wounded soldier and that the bottle was filled with not whiskey but plasma The bus then picked up some South Korean refugees followed by some wounded soldiers who brought news of an enemy patrol in the area The bus later pulls off the road and everyone is told to stay quiet so they would not be discovered by the enemy One woman carried a live chicken that would not stop squawking prompting Pierce to angrily admonish her to keep that damn chicken quiet after which the noise suddenly stopped This last detail causes Pierce to break down sobbing as he finally reveals the true ending of the story When Hawkeye snapped at the woman he had told her to keep not a chicken quiet but rather her baby Unable to keep the baby from crying the woman made the decision to smother her own child to silence it and protect the lives of the people on the bus Upon seeing what had happened Pierce was so traumatized that he repressed the memory of what occurred Once back at camp he attempted to operate on a patient without anesthesia while accusing the anesthesiologist of trying to smother the patient But it was a later incident driving a jeep through the wall of the Officers Club and ordering a double bourbon  that caused Pierce to be committed to the mental hospital With the true memory of the events on the bus now restored to him Pierce can acknowledge the fact that he suffered a nervous breakdown and was in the process of writing his father that he might be coming home soon as he doubted the Army would let a surgeon operate whose cheese has slipped off his cracker But Freedman deciding that Pierce is ready to be released sends him back to the 4077th promising to check up on him periodically Back at the 4077th an outofcontrol tank runs over the camp latrines forcing Maj Charles Winchester to go to a temporary facility down the road to relieve himself Encountering a raggedy group of five Chinese soldiers on a motorcycle he is greatly surprised when they surrender and follow him back to camp playing musical instruments Capt BJ Hunnicutt takes possession of the motorcycle and later annoys Winchester by painting it yellow Winchester irritated that he is about to miss his chance to win a coveted position at a hospital in Boston consoles himself by conducting the Chinese musicians in rehearsals of one of his favorite Mozart works the first movement of the Clarinet Quintet  On the surface he is irritated with them over their inability to play the piece correctly but he is actually bonding with and growing quite fond of them Maj Margaret Houlihan learns of his situation and puts in a good word with the Boston hospitals board but her efforts earn his ire when he finds out about them With the crashed tank still in the camp and Col Sherman Potter under orders not to have it moved for the time being enemy forces begin a mortar assault against the 4077th Several POWs locked in a makeshift pen in the compound are unable to get to safety until Father Francis Mulcahy lets them out In the process a mortar round explodes knocking him out and leaving him with severe hearing loss  Only Hunnicutt knows about Mulcahys condition and Mulcahy begs him not to tell anyone else as it could result in his being sent home unable to help the local orphans Shortly before Pierce returns from the mental hospital Hunnicutt receives his discharge papers and leaves for home Just as he is boarding a chopper Sgt Max Klinger shows Potter a justarrived set of orders that rescinds the discharge but Potter cannot  hear Klinger over the chopper The shorthanded operatingroom staff is soon swamped with patients and Potter calls headquarters to get another surgeon to replace Hunnicutt Pierce arriving after Hunnicutts departure is upset that his roommate left without saying goodbye much as his old friend Trapper John McIntyre had Shortly afterward during another barrage of enemy shelling Pierce drives the crashed tank through the newly built latrine and into the camps garbage dump to draw the shelling away from the camp This impulsive action by Pierce coming on the heels of his breakdown prompts Potter to call Freedman in for another talk with Pierce In the meantime a Korean refugee from a previous episode SoonLee Han is still on the base and trying to find her parents Klinger becomes worried when he learns that she has left to find them and the two realize that they have feelings for one another They decide to get married but much to Klingers frustration SoonLee insists that she cannot leave Korea until she finds her family A North Korean incendiary bomb attack causes wildfires in the adjacent forest and Potter orders the 4077th to bug out  As soon as the camp is up and running again in its new location Potter gets the replacement

for him but had no time to do so The 4077th throws a party for Hunnicutt who had intended to be home in time for his daughters second birthday and for a local orphan girl who is about that age Seeing many children at the party Pierce becomes withdrawn and tries to slip away but Freedman who shows up during the festivities reassures him He considers Pierces commandeering of the tank to be a sensible action that took his fellow soldiers out of danger Pierces feelings about the thought of a patient under his care not surviving Freedman says may make him an even better doctor than he already is Winchester eventually has to say goodbye to the Chinese musicians who are to be part of a POW exchange As they are driven away they finally play the Mozart piece correctly for him A publicaddress announcement then broadcasts the news that a truce has been signed a ceasefire will go into effect at 1000 that night officially ending the hostilities But the celebration is shortlived as Potter orders the camp moved back to its original site so the remaining wounded can be treated Among the wounded is one of the musicians barely alive after the truck carrying the POWs was shelled None of the other four survived and this one soon dies as well A shaken Winchester retires to his tent where he plays a record of the Mozart piece they were rehearsing then angrily yanks it from the turntable and smashes it In the operating room Hawkeye finds himself about to operate on a child and hesitates at first When Potter offers to switch patients with him he declines and goes to work

your pants and slide on the ice The radio announcer mentions hostilities in Vietnam to which a surgeon asks Wheres that The staff continues operating throughout the night stopping only briefly to take

know his patients and Hunnicutt jokes about running off with a girl he met during his travel delay then says he will return home to his family in San Francisco Winchester has won the position he wanted at the Boston hospital and agrees to accept it despite Houlihans meddling but remarks that the music that he had loved and used as a refuge from the experience will now serve as a reminder of the deaths of the Chinese musicians and the war itself The big surprise of the evening comes from Klinger who announces his intent to marry SoonLee and stay in Korea to help find her family The wedding takes place the next morning with Mulcahy officiating Potter as best man and Houlihan as matron of honor  After the ceremony the staff begins tearing down the camp and prepares to move out by

newspaper clipping found in the briefcase there is the story of a young woman crushed to death by a tree that falls in heavy winds during a storm Acting on this knowledge Neumeyer prevents her death

gets involved All three suspects again have motive and freedom to kill JT  Sikorski is revealed to have been working against JT all along He has been Bremmers partner he knows of Claudias true

opens the letter puts the envelope behind on a stone wall surrounding the well and starts reading the letter But she cant read properly and cant figure out whats written in itshe asks Mohini for help but she cant read either She says she would have gone and joined the army if she knew how to read and write When they see people coming towards them she tries to collect the envelope and leave from there but in a hurry she misses it and the envelope goes flying down into the well Theres a beautiful song here  Allah megh de The letter finally reaches the Chaudhary and he reads it but is perplexed thinking how the Daakiya could have brought the letter without an envelope which means no address Chhutki lies to him saying that the letter was delivered without the envelope And as though her saying so would help she says  Good that the kept the envelope Imagine if he had to keep the letter and just give the envelope to us We would never get to know whats in the letter When Daakiya comes the following morning Chaudhary is still perplexed wondering about the missing envelope and he asks him if he has come to distribute just the envelopes today Now its Ravis turn to get confused Hes accused of taking the envelope away  Finally Mohini comes to his rescues and spills the truth to Chaudhary Next he goes searching for Aarti Sharma to give Money orderwhen he reaches her house he sees her busy making quilts She stops her work to chat with him for a while and says that its her husbands pension Aazadi ke jung mein saheed hue the  She claims to be an armys widow and yet she puts sindoor Hes kind of confused And finding his puzzled expression very natural she goes on to explain that shes Amar suhagan and all the others in the village call her Suhagi didi She says she waits for this day not because she would get money but for her husbandshe feels connected to him in some way and when she puts sindoor she feels that hes still somewhere around Ravi takes her hand and takes her thumb impression on the paper before giving her the Pension amount But she doesnt keep the moneyshe sends it for the welfare of other armies who are fighting day and night protecting the country and ensuring everybodys safety At the end he realizes that shes educated and can converse fluently in English as well He leaves feeling embarrassed for taking her thumb impression instead of asking her to

and continues with his work Mohini   Do you want some water Ravi   Yes a glass of water please Mohini  What will a glass of water do I will have to get a bucket full of water for you And then she asks him if he would want some waterto this he replies  Ravi  Yes but not in a bucket She goes towards the house and then stops half way through to ask if buttermilk would do He nods And she comes with a glass of buttermilk for him Mohini  if I get any letters do give it to me Ravi  Who else would I give it to Mohini Oh I mean dont give it to Maa Ravi  Once bitten twice shy I would never make that mistake again I have learnt a lot from Chaudhary saabs letter episode  She behaves pretty mysterious asking about letters so he asks her if she gets letters often Mohini  No but just in case if I get any letters Ravi  You wait so much for them you must have got them earlier too Mohini  No not yet but Ravi  Who is it that you expect to hear from so much Mohini   I am supposed to get a letter form my Mamaji And goes away saying she has to give buttermilk to her cow Ravi  Buttermilk To cow Mohini  I mean waterdont know what I am saying today Ravi   You get so confused has it ever happened that you kept your food plate in front of the cow and started eating the grass yourself She laughs and goes away Ravi sings Daakiya daak laaya as he goes about his work He comes home from work very hungry and asks Parcel for food Raghu gives him water and starts asking about Mohini The entire village is talking about the two of them now Ravi confides that he likes Mohini but has no idea how she feels for him Just then Parcel comes with a sheet of paper and asks Raghu if its okRaghu after going through it approves of it and asks Parcel to post it Ravi is confused as to what they both are up to Raghu explains to him that nobody ever wrote him a letter in his life so hes making Parcel write one and post it He would reply to it on receiving it One day on his way back home Ravi sees Mohini sitting on a tree branch and staringHe asks her what shes looking at and she says she was thinking about the armies who were there few months ago for training She would sit there and look at them for hours together Mohini  This area used to be so full of armies some time back and now Ravi  And now lets both go and do a parade Mohini  Who will distribute your letters then Ravi  We could ask anybody to do thatwhats the name of that liar friend of yours Chhutki Let her go around giving the letters and her father will go behind her with the envelopes She asks him why he didnt come and sit under the Peepal tree today to sort his letters and mentions she was actually waiting for him the whole day Ravi  You were waiting for me or for your mamajis letter Mohini  Had made daliya today you come everyday so had kept some for you too Ravi  Is it still there or did you give it to your cow Mohini  I have kept some for you Ravi  Ok then I have to go to Suhagi didis house now Ill come over after that  Suhagi has made some quilts and blankets and she gives them to Ravi to send them across to some regiment Ravi comes to Mohinis place to have daliya He barely sits down when Mohinis cow breaks free and runs away with the rope entangled with Ravis cycle Mohinis cow running away with Ravis cycle  this becomes such a big breaking news and the hottest gossip in the village Ravi goes behind the cow and finally brings both the cow and cycle home But he gets hurt in the process So Mohini tends to his wounds She notices Suhagis parcel and asks Ravi about it Him  She has sent it for the armies Her  What if I want to send a parcel to somebody Him  You should have his name and regiment address and it will reach him Butwhy You know any fauji Her  No I was just asking Rekha makes a special appearance in this dance  Surme wale sainyaan hamaro ji After a few days she meets him by that tree again and takes his measurements for a sweater Hes very happy and is now sure that she likes him too Another day she complains that he never brings a letter for her and then he promises to bring a letter for her the following day He goes home that night and sits awake the whole night writing a letter to her  putting down his feelings on paper When he meets her he gives her the letter and shes extremely delighted Then she shows him the sweater she has knit and asks him to try it Hes happily trying it out when she looks at the letter and says  now that he has written to me and I have his address I can send the sweater too He is shocked to find out that its not for him All his dreams are shattered and hes heart is broken She then tells him her story  She had met Ravi  an army officer when his battalion was training near her village fallen in love with him and had also quietly married

same day he receives a telegram saying that the Army Officer he was looking for has been killed in the war With a heavy heart he goes to give the news to Mohini but theres a huge crowd gathered there Mohini tells him that Rasullas mother died of sorrow because somebody told her that her son is dead Ravi feels guilty and tells her that he was the one who had read the letter out to her At this she tells him he should have lied and hidden the truth from her At least a lie would have saved her life Everybody in the village knew of Rasullas death but nobody had dared to break the news to her because they were scared she would die of shock Now Ravi  cannot bring himself to tell Mohini of Ravis  death And he goes back home with a heavier heart Hes in a dilemma as to whether to tell Mohini the truth or to hide it from her Mohini on the other hand now aware that the war has come to an end starts waiting all the more eagerly for Ravi   Ghungta gira hai What will Ravi do now Will he ever be able to tell Mohini the truth Will she ever come to know that he was once in love with her Will she misunderstand his intentions Mohinis Maa is pressurizing her to get marriedhow long will she be

hospital The film then flashbacks to the past to her childhood Michelle was a girl who lost her eyesight and hearing after recovering from an illness at the age of two and exists in a black world where she is isolated in the darkness of her own existence trapped by her inability to see hear and express She grows up becoming more and more frustrated by the black and dark world around her making her a violent uncontrollable eightyear old child Her parents Paul and Catherine are at their wits end trying to control her until one day the light shines through the end of the tunnel Debraj Sahai enters their lives an elderly alcoholic teacher for the deaf and blind Debraj sees himself as a magician and is a disillusioned eccentric man He takes it upon himself to bring young Michelle into the light He uses harsh methods although always for Michelles longterm benefit Initially his methods are met with disapproval by Michelles father who asks Debraj to leave Although her father thinks he is gone Debraj stays as the teacher while her father is away on business for 20 days Her mother grudgingly approves of his continuation given her fear of Michelle being sent to an asylum By the 20th day Debraj manages to teach Michelle some words and better manners but he has difficulty teaching her the meaning of words When Michelles father returns Debraj packs his bags At the very last moment as he is walking towards the door suitcase in hand Debraj gets frustrated with Michelles continuing insolent behavior and he throws her into a fountain full of water Michelle suddenly takes to Debrajs

Michelles teacher Many years later Michelle has learned a great deal becoming relaxed and expressive and she is even able to dance and expertly sign Debraj convinces the Principal of a university to grant her an interview which she passes and gets admission to pursue a Bachelor of Arts degree the first deafblind person to do so at that university Michelle moves away from home and lives with Debraj and one of her servants Over the next 2 years she struggles to gain her Bachelor of Arts degree failing year after year but she still maintains her spirit One reason is that she must rely on Debraj completely for interpretation of the material and studying This problem is overcome by the Principal of the school preparing the whole firstyear Arts course of study in Braille Another reason for her continuing failure is that her typing skills are lacking and typing is her only way to write down what she knows during exams However she also soon overcomes this deficiency through another flash of increased of competence when she almost quits the university and gets into an argument with Debraj As the same time as Michelle suffers through and triumphs over her challenges we also witness numerous other changes Debraj begins to succumb to Alzheimers first forgetting the way out of the Principals office and then forgetting Michelle and leaving her stranded during an ice cream celebration for her improved typing We also see Michelle reconcile with her sister Sara who we find out was jealous of her parents affection for Michelle throughout her life After attending Saras wedding Michelle begins to wonder about love which she has not experienced and she even asks Debraj to kiss her on the lips Debraj reluctantly does so but decides to leave Michelle on her own because of this demand and the position she has put him in Twelve years after enrollment Michelle does manage to gain her BA and with her proud parents looking on her she even gives a speech to the graduating class Wearing no black graduation robe she thanks her parents and her teacher and she announces that she will only wear the robe so that her teacher may see her first Debraj is in a mental hospital due to his almost complete inability to remember his past and even how to speak Michelle visits him wearing her robe and we see glimmers of memory return as Debraj realizes that she has graduated and even does a victory dance As the window opens to the rain outside we see Debrajs hand in Michelles reaching into the rain and we hear the teacherstudent pair say the first syllable of the word water with echoes of the scene in which Michelle first begins understanding the meaning of words earlier in the movie However this time it is Debraj who is beginning to learn to speak and understand The movie ends with a scene of Michelle amongst a crowd of people all dressed in black carrying candles walking towards a church There is a voiceover of a letter Michelle has written to Debrajs friend Mrs Nair explaining that today was her teachers first day of school and that like hers his alphabet began with B L A C K implying that Debraj had finally succumbed to his illness and died',
